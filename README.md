**I'm currently working with** React (mostly and TypeScript).

**I like studying and playing around with** systems programming, using languages such as C, Rust and Zig.

**Sometimes I work with** Java (Spring), JavaScript, Node.js and Next.js.

### What am I doing here?
I've spent a lot of time working for software companies only, so I felt like I could do better contributing to OSS. Keeping that in mind, I'm also trying to work on some of my own ideas, sharing them here, on GitHub :)
